# About MinigameBox

The MinigameBox is a small project that aims to create an easy way to run a diverse set of
minigames on your server. It lets you create and edit game arenas in your world, allowing players to play games like
spleef and similar games. The focus is to maintain and expand a high level of customizablity and constantly expand the set
of minigames. I tried to design the plugin to be as self-explanatory and intuitive as possible, but I plan to
create a guide someday. If questions arise or you want to give some feedback, contact me on GitHub or Discord @upscairs.
Note: This plugin doesn't protect the arena outside if minigames, control pvp (but that might change), or create a huge 
build for the arena. The plugin just creates the barebones functionality.

### Status Quo

The number of the minigames you can play at the moment is, well, one - Spleef. My plans are to increase that number
obviously, but I want to build a solid foundation first. A foundation that allows me and everyone else who wants to 
work with it to have it as easy as possible.

### The future

I started this plugin as a hobby, because I like to work on it and I will keep working on it until I have no ideas 
anymore (that's quite unlikely) or I don't have any fun or time in doing it anymore. I don't see a reason why that
would happen in the near future, but I thought it would be fair to let you know ;)

But let's talk about features:

For upcoming minigames I have planned:
- TntRun

And new features are:
- More options in the edit and queue gui
- More customizability in guis
- The guide mentioned in the introduction
